## Contributing

Feel free to post anything you feel may be useful to another team member. In order to add a resource, all you need is the following:
- A link to a code repository or Github Gist.
- A .README file (If you're linking to a code repository).
  - Follow [Barrel Best Practices](https://github.com/barrel/barrel-dev-best-practices/blob/master/documentation.md) when constructing the README file
- Intuitive code comments (block and inline).

### README.md Formatting

When adding to this repository's README file, please format resources in the following way:
```md
- **[Resource Title](https://barrelny.com)** - Subtitle

  The resource description. Extend on the title. Provide an executive summary of the resource.

  ###### *Tagged: Tag 1, Tag 2, Tag 3* â€“ Author: @barreldeveloper
```
The example above has the following elements:
- A linked title. The link points to the Gist or repository URL.
- A subtitle. Summarize the core functionality of the resource in a few words.
- A Description. Keep succinct (1-3 sentences).
- Tags. Consider the keywords you may search for when looking for this research. Include the platform (if applicable) and language.
