# Code Resources
The intent of this repo is to serve as a searchable index of code snippets, libraries, and examples. These can come from anyone on the team, and shouldn't be limited to what we've written for clients. If you wrote something cool and think others should use it, please share it here!

Additionally, these projects do not need to be complete or production ready. This can and should be a place to store WIPs, ideas, and get feedback.

Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md for more info on what to post here.
